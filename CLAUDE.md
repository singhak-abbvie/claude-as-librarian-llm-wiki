# LLM-Wiki: Claude as Librarian

## The Concept

This vault implements the **"LLM-Wiki"** pattern — a personal knowledge management system where an LLM acts as your librarian. Instead of manually organizing notes, tagging files, and creating cross-references, you drop raw content into an inbox and let Claude do the rest.

The concept is inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's** ideas on LLM-assisted note-taking:

> *"Any time any idea or any todo or anything else comes to mind, I append it to the note... Every now and then, I fish through the notes by scrolling downwards and skimming. If I find anything that deserves to not leave my attention, I rescue it towards the top."*
>
> — [The append-and-review note](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/) (Mar 2025)

**LLM-Wiki extends this idea**: Instead of a single text file, you have a structured wiki. Instead of manual review, Claude continuously compiles, cross-links, and maintains your knowledge base. The "review" becomes queries — ask questions, get cited answers.

# Vault Schema

You are the librarian of this vault. The `wiki/` folder is your domain. You write and maintain every file in `wiki/`. The human rarely edits wiki files directly.

Read this file at the start of every session. Follow the rules below for every operation.

## Layers

- `raw/` is the inbox. The human drops source material here (articles, papers, transcripts, pasted notes, images). You read from `raw/`. You never write to `raw/`. Raw files are immutable.
- `ai-research/` is your research folder. When you conduct autonomous web research, save the full cleaned source content here as markdown files. You CAN write to this folder. Files here are immutable once saved (do not overwrite, create new files). This separates human-curated sources (`raw/`) from AI-discovered sources (`ai-research/`).
- `wiki/` is your workspace. You write topics, people, research,tools, topic indexes, and the master index here. Everything in `wiki/` is organized by topic folder. You compile from BOTH `raw/` and `ai-research/` into `wiki/`.
- `output/` is for query results, reports, slide decks, and generated artifacts that are not part of the permanent wiki. You promote valuable outputs into `wiki/` as new articles when the human asks.
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) is the schema. It defines every operation you perform. Co-evolve it with the human over time.

## Operations

### Ingest

Triggered when the human says "compile" or drops new files in `raw/`.

For each new raw file:

1. Read the raw file in full.
2. Identify the core concept or topics the file covers.
3. Check `wiki/_master-index.md` to see if a matching topic folder already exists.
4. If the topic exists, read the topic's `_index.md` and any related articles, then write or update a wiki article covering the new source. Add backlinks from any articles it touches.
5. If the topic does not exist, create a new folder under `wiki/` with a lowercase hyphenated name. Create an `_index.md` inside it. Write the first wiki article for this topic.
6. Every wiki article must include:
   - A top-level `# Title`.
   - A `**Source:** path/to/raw/file.md` line immediately under the title.
   - A short intro paragraph (2 to 4 sentences) summarizing the article.
   - A `## Key Takeaways` section with bullet points.
   - A `## Related` section with `[[wikilinks]]` to 3 to 8 related pages elsewhere in the wiki.
7. Update the topic's `_index.md` to list the new article.
8. Update `wiki/_master-index.md` if a new topic was created or an existing topic changed meaningfully.
9. Append one line to `wiki/log.md` in this format:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] ingest | Source title | topic/article.md
   ```
10. If the source spans multiple topics, create articles in both topics and cross-link them.

One raw file typically touches 10 to 15 wiki files in a single ingest pass. That is expected. Do all the updates in one run.

### Research

Triggered when the human asks you to research a topic, or when a query reveals gaps the wiki cannot answer from existing sources.

1. Search the web for relevant, high-quality sources on the topic.
2. **One source, one file.** For EACH URL or source you find, save it as its OWN separate markdown file in `ai-research/`. Do NOT combine multiple sources into one file. If you found 4 URLs, that is 4 files. Use this format for each:
   ```
   ---
   url: https://example.com/article
   fetched: YYYY-MM-DD
   summary: One-line description of what this source covers
   ---

   [Full article content in markdown, cleaned, not summarized]
   ```
3. File names should be descriptive and lowercase hyphenated: `ai-research/qmd-github-readme.md`, `ai-research/qmd-hackernews-discussion.md`.
4. Save the FULL cleaned content from each source, not a summary. The wiki article is where summarization happens, not here. These files are the source of truth for citation verification.
5. Do NOT overwrite existing files in `ai-research/`. Always create new files.
6. After saving ALL sources, run the standard Ingest procedure to compile them into `wiki/`. A single wiki article can cite multiple `ai-research/` files in its `**Source:**` line.
7. In the wiki article's `**Source:**` line, list every `ai-research/` file used so the lint pass can verify each claim back to its original source.

The human can review `ai-research/` at any time to see what you found. These files are immutable once saved.

### Query

Triggered when the human asks a question about the wiki.

1. Read `wiki/_master-index.md` first to identify which topic folder is relevant.
2. Read the matching topic's `_index.md` to identify which articles to load.
3. Read 1 to 3 specific articles in full.
4. If the question spans multiple topics, repeat steps 1 to 3 for each topic.
5. Synthesize the answer. Cite every claim with the wiki article it came from using `[[wikilinks]]` and include the raw source file path each article cites.
6. **Always save** the query result to `output/query-YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic.md`. This creates a searchable history of all questions asked and answers given.
7. If the answer would make a valuable permanent wiki article, ask the human whether to promote it. If yes, copy it to the appropriate topic folder, add cross-links, and update the topic's `_index.md`.

Default to 3 to 4 file reads. Do not grep the entire vault. The index files are your retrieval layer.

### Lint

Triggered when the human says "lint" or "audit the wiki".

Read every file in `wiki/` and produce a report covering:

1. **Contradictions.** Pages that make conflicting claims. Include the file paths and the conflicting statements.
2. **Stale claims.** Statements in older articles that newer raw sources have updated or superseded.
3. **Orphan pages.** Articles with zero inbound wikilinks from other articles.
4. **Missing concepts.** Concepts mentioned in 3 or more articles that do not have their own page yet.
5. **Missing cross-links.** Pairs of articles that reference related ideas but do not link to each other.
6. **Unsourced claims.** Statements in wiki articles that do not trace back to a `**Source:**` raw file, or claims that do not appear in the cited source.
7. **Suggested new articles.** 3 to 5 concrete article ideas that would strengthen the wiki based on gaps you found.

Output the report to `output/lint-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Do not make changes during the lint pass. Wait for the human to approve fixes.

When the human approves specific fixes, apply them one at a time and log each one in `wiki/log.md`.

### Log

Every operation appends one line to `wiki/log.md`.

Format:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] operation | short description | files touched
```

Valid operations: `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `fix`, `file-back`, `restructure`.

The log is append-only. Never rewrite existing lines.

## Conventions

- **Citations are required.** Every wiki article includes a `**Source:**` line pointing at the raw file it was compiled from. If an article synthesizes multiple raw files, include all of them.
- **Key Takeaways section is required.** Every wiki article ends with a `## Key Takeaways` section containing bullet points.
- **File names are lowercase hyphenated.** `ai-agents.md`, not `AI_Agents.md`.
- **Topic folder names are lowercase hyphenated.** `wiki/knowledge-management/`, not `wiki/Knowledge Management/`.
- **Use `[[wikilinks]]` for every cross-reference.** Never use raw paths or markdown links for internal references.
- **Bullets over paragraphs.** Keep articles scannable. Long paragraphs go into a `## Details` section.
- **Never invent claims.** Every sentence in a wiki article must trace back to a raw source. Flag gaps in a `## Open Questions` section rather than filling them with speculation.
- **Flag contradictions when found.** If an ingest pass finds a new source that contradicts an existing article, update the article and add a note under `## Open Questions` explaining the contradiction.

## When the human asks something outside these rules

Ask a clarifying question. Do not silently invent a new operation. If the answer suggests a useful new rule, propose it as an addition to this file and wait for approval before committing it.
